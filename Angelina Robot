Project Desription:

On Thursday October 24th, 
Angelina, our robot, will be able to rotate in its place while moving its arms 
together up and also moving one of its legs the same way while the other stays 
still, mimicking a ballerina dance. As the robot spins at different randomized 
speeds, the LED lit skirt its wearing will change colors according to that.
