# performingRobots


On Thursday October 24th, 
Angelina, our robot, will be able to rotate in her place while moving her arms 
together up and down while also moving one her legs the same way. The other leg
stays still. With her movements, Angelina will mimic a ballerina dance. As she
spins in which she's spinning goes faster or slower, the LED lit skirt she's 
wearing will change colors accordingly.
