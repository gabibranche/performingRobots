Challenges:

1 - Putting all the part together and synchronizing them:
        Everything works well on it's own. The challenging part was getting them to work together in a meaningful
        to mimic a ballerina dance. The trickiest part was getting both arms to move together because the servos
        were going oppoiste ways. The other tricky part was adjusting the speed of the base to the beats of the
        music, so that Angelina would spin faster as the beat goes faster. 
        
2 - Strong base:
        Angelina has all her weight carried on one leg. On the first try, we assumed that the leg was stronger
        than it actually was. The next morning, Angelina was bent backwards, almost falling back because the 
        base leg was not strong enough. We had to work on making the leg stronger and balancing out the weight.
        
3 - Time management:
        We continuously under estimated the time it would take us to complete each step. We assume it would
        take us a specific amount of time, and then a bug occurs or something breaks and we need to spend
        double or tiple that time working to fix it.
