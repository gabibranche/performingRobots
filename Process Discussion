Challenges:

1 - Putting all the part together and synchronizing them:
        Everything works well on it's own. The challenging part was getting them to work together in a meaningful
        to mimic a ballerina dance. The trickiest part was getting both arms to move together because the servos
        were going oppoiste ways. The other tricky part was adjusting the speed of the base to the beats of the
        music, so that Angelina would spin faster as the beat goes faster. 
        
2 - Strong base:
        Angelina has all her weight carried on one leg.
